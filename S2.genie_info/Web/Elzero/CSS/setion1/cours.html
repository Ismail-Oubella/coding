Background Color, Image, Repeat


<!-- 
    Background Color :
    to use background color we can set color by name but their is a lot pf colores
    without name so we can use :
    rgb(red, green, blue) its a function that every one can take value between 0 and 255;
        rgb(255,255,255) => white color;
        rgb(0,0,0) => black color;
        then the last is the alpha channel it text value by "%", The alpha channel 
        controls the transparency or opacity of a color. 

            rgba(R,G,B / Alpha channel) declaration function; alpa chanel is by %
                (alpha channel == opacity)

            Hex code :
                #RR GG BB =>  takes from 0 -> FF by hexa

            HSL code : 
                hsl(xÂ°"degress",%"saturation",%"lightness")

        
    Background image :
        background-image: url(""); we put the background image link inside the url;
        background-repeat => sets the number of repeat its defualt is repeat but 
                            we can set "no-repeat" to that it can be once , 
                            or (repeat-x) repeat horizontally , (repeat-y)
                            Repeat vertically;

Background  Attachment, Position, Size

<!-- 
    background-attachment => The background-attachment property is used to specify 
        that the background image is fixed or scroll with the rest of the page in 
        the browser window.it's default value is "scroll" abd we can use 
        "fixed" to that it can fix in it's position.

    background-position => The background-position we can split the screen into 9 
        squares (columns="left,center,right" and lines="top,center,bottom"); 
        default is center;

        by px/% : background-position : "left" px/% "top" px/%; 

    background-size : specifies the size of the background images, it's default 
        value is auto that keep it in it's original size, but we can use "cover"
        Resize the background image to cover the entire container, even if it 
        has to stretch the image or cut a little bit off one of the edges, and "contain"
        Resize the background image to make sure the image is fully visible;
        and we can use hight and width to specify the size of the background image
        "width" then "height" when we make it 100% in eich one of them it stretch;
