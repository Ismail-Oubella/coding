Master The CSS Calculation :
    content width is 100%;
    i want 5 spaces;
    1% * 5 = 5% from content width;
    95% available space;
    4 Elemenets the width is : 95%/4 ;
    
    6 spaces ;
    5 Elemenets => 94% available;
    94%/5 is the width;

    if 2% to every space ;
    so 88% available space;
    88% / 5 is the width;

    we use calc() function;

    content width is 100%;
    i want 6 spaces;
    15px * 6 = 90px from content width;
    100%-90px available space;
    4 Elemenets the width is : (100% - 90 px)/5 ;
