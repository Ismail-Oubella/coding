Semantic Elements

<!--
    header =>  head of wesite
    nav => navigation bar 
    section => the content of the website all is inside it/defines a section in a document.
    aside => side bar
    footer => footer of the page
    main=> specifies the main content of a document.
    picture => gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources.

    they are div but with a name that give it's purpose instead of using 
    a lot of classes
    footer and header can be used more than once in a page
    theire is only one side bar in page
    
    insted of 
        <div>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <p></p>
        </div>

    we can use :

    figure => that give us the possiblity of upload an image with caption instead 
    of using div continer
    figcaption => caption 
        <figure>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>

    all  this is to avoid this :

    <div>
        <div>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <div></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

Audio/Video : 

<!--
    audio have src attribute we can use source tag inside it wich is better to use 
    source tag have also src attribute and type every type have an "MME type " for example
    mp3 audio => audio/mpeg and we do a lot of source attribute to that if the browser 
    doesn't support one it find the other but now all browsers support .mp3 so 
    use it with MME type audio/mpeg
    <audio controls>
        <source 
        src=".mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        your browser doesn't support audio rags
    </audio>

    inside audio tag can play the role of alt attribute 

    audio tag have attributes :
        controls => that shows pause/rsum and all buttons ;
        autoplay => autoplay audio / Chrome doesn't support it anymore but edge still;
        loop ;
        muted;


    it the same for video tag; just use mp4 extension 'video/mp4' we can use 
    width and height attributes

    but video have his attributes :
        poster => that shows img;
        track => is to translation it have src , kind ,srclang ,label.... attributes;

        preload=>attribute specifies if and how the author thinks that the video 
                should be loaded when the page loads.(auto,metadata,none)

                The preload attribute is ignored if autoplay is present.

Form :

<!--
    part 1:

    the form element contains some of form editable to send it to a server;
    inside it theire are :

        label => the name

        input => inline block self closing tag it give us choice to write 
        in fields ...

            type => text , password ,submit 

    part 2:

        required => attribute that must have written in the field 
        placeholder =>  specifies a short hint that describes 
        the expected value of an input field

        type is very important ;

    part 3 :

    action attribute in form name="email" required placeholder="Write a valid Email" value="a@jdjd.ma"element
        action => specifies where to send the form-data when a form is submitted.
        method =>  specifies how to send form-data (get => send data in the url (google search) != post doesn't show it )
        
    part 4:

    input types :

        hidden => we use it also to send data that it's not necessary that the user 
                    se it (id ...)
        reset => reset the form
        Color => set a color
        range => set a range it has attributes min max also set and value that set 
                    the initial value ;
        Number => only numbers also it has min and max step;

    part 5:

        readonly => like username it can be unchanged (in some cases)
        disabled => unchanged and olso it unsended 
        autofocus => autofocus in a field
        minlength => set the minimum number of characters in a field
        maxlength => set the maximum number of characters in a field

    part 6 :

    input types :
        radio => Only one radio button in a group can be selected at the same time.
        checkbox => Checkboxes are used to let a user select one or more options of a limited number of choices.

        for => attribute in label tag give us the access to connect it with the 
                    input by give it an id setted before in the input using id 
                    attribute

    part 7 :

        select => Select from a list hidden by default;
        option => Options to select ; have an value attribute that will be sended 
                    not the text;

        optgroup =>  is used to group related options in a <select> 
            element (drop-down list),   and has the atribute label , multiple attributes
            that give the choise to select more than one option(inside select) , selected attribute
            just like autofocus option it appers rather than the order of the list(inside option);

        
        textarea =>  defines a multi-line text input control.

    part 8 :

    input types :
            
        file => defines a file-select field and a "Browse" button for file uploads.

        url => only url can be sent
        date => choose date format;
        month /time => choose month format/time 

    part 9 :

            novalidate => form can be submitted without validation(form attribute)
            target => same one before (form attribute), its benificial in test cases
            
            to create a list like select tag but by input we use the datalist tag
            with option inside it and link the datalist with the input by an id that 
            named list inside input and id in the datalist but this list give us the 
            choise to search through the list;
