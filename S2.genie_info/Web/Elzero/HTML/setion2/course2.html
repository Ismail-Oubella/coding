table : 
<!--
    thead 
    tbody
    tfoot

        those thags are to orginize the table whatever happened in the code 

    tr => table row (row of cells)
    td => table data cell

    th => table header cell (caracterd by css styling like its bold )

    some attributes to use :
        border ,  cellpadding , 
        but we have not to use it inside html

    caption => heading fo table

    colspan => it takes the number of columns to merge with ...
    rowspan => it takes the number of rows to merge with ...
-->


span / br/hr /div: 

<!--
    span is an inline element, if i wanna to style a part is p we use it because we 
    cant select words to style them.
    so it is just to styling purpose 

    br => new line but we can do it in css

    hr => horizontal row block element

    div is a container and dont use it to text
-->

html entities 

    <!--
        for example when i wanna to weite <p></p> but not as a code i wanna print it in the 
    browser i cant because he consider it as a tag or html element so we use
    entities 
        <p></p> => &lt;p&gt;
        lt => less than with ; in the end;
        gt => greater than ;
        copy => copywright logo;
        trade => TM logo
        reg   => R logo
